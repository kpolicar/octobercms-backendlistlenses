# Why do I need this?
Are you often applying the same filters to your lists? Wouldn't it be easier to have a dedicated page that you could share with others that has all your filters (*and more*) already applied? With lenses, that's exactly what you get. Create backend pages with a custom query applied to your list. You can also modify the list columns if you wish.

# Features
- Blends into OctoberCMS as if it were a native feature
- Automatically uses the controller's default list configuration
- Configurable like any other OctoberCMS controller behavior (List, Form, Relation, etc.)
- Built with October - there are no external assets or dependencies

> **Compatible with OctoberCMS v2**
